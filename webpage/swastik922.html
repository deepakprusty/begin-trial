His father Kaba Gandhi was the Dewan of Kathiaward in Rajkot. He was a higly spirited gentleman of honesty and intergrity. His mother Putuli Bai was a pious lady. In his childhood he was shy and timid. He was led astary by some bad companions, but soon he corrected himself and never relapsed.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">After his matriculation he went to continue his studies at Bhabanagar College but failed to follow his learned teachers. On the advice of his family adviser he was sent to Englang to study law. There he led an austere lif  totally abstaining from wine and women. He came back t o india after being  barrister.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gandhiji started his legal practice in Kathaiaward but did not prove himself a good lawyer. It was beacuse he was an ardent lover of truth and did not compromise anything immoral with truth. </p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">He got an appointment as legal adviser of an Indian mercantile firm in South Africa. He went there and found the Indians suffering most miserably and living wretchedly under humiliating conditions. But the Indians in South Africa were too timid to resist it. Gandhiji took up the cause of his  countrymen. He organised them together and advice them for fight for their rights As there leder he struggled had for years to free them from the inhuman treatment meted out of them by the british rulers. For this reason he had to sufferimprisonment and physical torture. In the end he succeeded in getting many of the anti-Indian laws repealed. This success brought love and affection of his countrymen. </p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 1914 he returned ti India and was warmly welcome by his countrymen. He was very sad to see the awful proverty of Indians. He was also shocked to see the cruel inhuman treatment given to them by the Britishers.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">He started his non-violent struggle for freedom of India.All the Indians followed him. Jawaharlal Nehru,Subhas Chandra Bose,Lala Lajpat Roy and other national leaders lent their support to him. He started Swadeshi and Boycott movements. Salt Satyagraha, non-co-operation and civil disobedience movement, Bandemataram movement and quit India movement. For these reasons he suffered imprisonment a many times. A lot Indians sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom. The whole of India was behind him.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">At long last the Britishers yielded to the pressing demand of the Indians for freedom. On te 14th of august 1947 India emerged as a free democratic nation under the powerful leadership of Gandhiji. He was deeply shocked at the partition of India into Pakistan and Hindustan. There were communalroits, blood shed, arson, looting and destruction of life and property. Gandhiji took up a fast for 21 days and put an end to such damnable situation. And he succeeded in restoring normacly among the fighting communities.</p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">He was a god like person and his life was a ceaseless experiment with truth and non-violence. For his sterling human qualites he was populary called Mahatma Gandhi or Bapuji. He was really  the father of our nation. No other leaders of the world can equal him in dignity and humanity. </p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">But it is a pity that a Hindu named Nathuram Godse put an end to his life while he is going to prayer hall in the evening of 30th January 1948. He instantly succumbed to the injuries of the bullets with "Hai Ram on his lips". </p>

<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">His death was an irreparable loss to India. The whole humanity, as some body said, was impoverished at the death of such a great leader and a humanist. </p>
